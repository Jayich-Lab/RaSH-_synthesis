## Chemicals:

100g Copper Sulfate Penta Hydride

30mL 37% HCl

30g Iron(II) Sulfide

## Procedure:

1) Put one H2S detector near the fumehood and another one outside of the fumehood room.
2) Fill a graduated cylinder with 50mL of DI water. Put 21 g of CuSO4 into the graduated cylinder. Stir the solution with the glass straw to dissolve until saturated.
3) Put 5 g of FeS into the three-neck flask.
4) Make sure that the addition funnel valve is closed, and replace the funnel with the addition funnel.
5) Add 10 mL of saturated HCl into the addition funnel. This amount of HCl is estimated to make 1-2 L of H2S.
6) Place the base of the three neck flask in an ice bath. We do this to cool the HCl during the reaction so that HCl vapor is produced in smaller quantities than it otherwise would be.
7) Close the valve connecting the three-neck flask with the CF valves, and we open the valve connecting the argon to the three-neck flask.
8) Disconnect the argon hose and turn the argon valve on the cylinder slightly on. Test for flow through the hose. Reconnect the hose and run argon through the three-neck flask with no cap on the addition funnel for about a minute. After that, turn off the argon and put the cap onto the addition funnel with no keck clamp. Make sure not to use the keck clamp! This cap is our only pressure blow off point. 
9) Make sure that the CF valves are open, and we open the valve connecting the three-neck flask to the CF valves. Turn on argon until the system is entirely flushed.
10) Turn off argon, and close the valve connecting the three-neck flask to argon.
11) Open the addition funnel valve slowly to introduce HCl into the three-neck flask to react with FeS. You should see bubbles in the CuSO4 solution, and after a while black precipitate will form in the solution. Then, close the addition funnel valve, and when bubbles are no longer forming, close off the two CF valves simultaneously. Take the glass cap off of the addition funnel.
12) Undo the KF connections around the two CF valves.
13) Blow out residual H2S in the two CF to KF connectors with N2, and remove the CF valves from the fumehood.
14) Open all valves on the three-neck flask and leave the addition funnel valve closed. Remove the cap on the addition funnel and flush with N2.
15) Pour residual HCl from the addition funnel into the HCl waste bottle and dilute with water.
16) Add water through a funnel into the three-neck flask, and pour the solution into another waste bottle.
17) Pour the CuSO4 solution (with precipitate) into a different waste bottle.
18) Clean all glassware.


# RaSH production
Instructions for making RaSH by leaking H2S gas into the vacuum chamber.

## Parts: 

3x CF valves

1x 1,33in CF "T"

1x 1.33in CF blank

1x CF 1.33 to KF16 converter

1x slow leak valve

1x Turbo Pump

KF16 tubing

CF 1.33in tubing

## Procedure
1) By following the previous procedure, we were able to securely store ~50 cubic cm of H2S gas between two closed CF valves (blue square in the image above). With the valves still closed, remove the CF to KF converters on either end of the CF piece from the previous procedure. 
2) On one end of the CF piece, bolt on a 1.33in CF blank. On the other end, bolt on a 1.33in CF 'T' piece. 
3) Working on the 'T' piece, attach one open end of the 'T' to a CF valve, and the other end of the 'T' to a CF tube connected to the slow leak valve on the trap. Then, using a CF to KF converter, attatch a piece of KF16 tubing to the new CF valve, and connect the the other end of that tube to the turbo pump. 
4) With the leak valve closed, and the H2S CF valves closed, open the CF valve that connects to the turbo pump. Turn on the turbo pump, and pump down the system until pressure is around 1x10^-4 mbar. 
5) Close the CF valve connecting the turbo pump, then turn off the turbo pump. 
6) Open the CF valve that connects the CF 'T' and the precision leak valve. There should now be a throughline for the H2S to get to the leak valve on the trap. H2S pressure will depend on the length of the CF tube used, but should be at least a factor of 5 less than 1 atm. 
7) Trap Ra ions. Then, by slowly opening the precision leak valve, introduce H2S into the trap. Look for gas collisions on the trap CCD and wait for a dark ion to be produced. Use OMS to confirm that RaSH is the dark ion. 

## Confirming RaSH+ production

We use Optical Mass Spectrometry with sub-dalton resolution to identify dark ions in our trap. https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.126.023002

Figure: An illustration of OMS on an arbitrary dark ion trapped between 2 "bright" Ra+ ions.
 
We begin with a chain of 2 or 3 Ra+ ions. Then, we leak in H2S gas (using the procedure above) and wait for one of the ions to go dark (depicted as a black box with a question mark in the figure above). We detune our 468nm cooling laser, which causes "global heating" and "local cooling" effects, leading our ion chain to oscillate axially in the trap with a frequency that is a function of the mass of the ions in the chain. 

When an ion goes dark, we immediately perform the OMS (Optical Mass Spectrometry) technique and record an FFT of the axial oscillation frequency. We continue to do this periodically, (about every 5 minutes), in order to check if the axial frequency is drifting due to pressure or temperature changes in the trap vacuum chamber. We continue to watch the dark ion until it dissociates, which normally takes on the order of one hour from initial production. As soon as the dark ion dissociates, we perform OMS on the the chain of bright ions. We use the data from the post-dissociation OMS FFT to calibrate the final dark ion OMS FFT, and end up with the following plot:

**With this plot, we can see that the dark ion has a mass of roughly 259 amu, equal to 226+33 (SH = 33 amu). This confirms the production of RaSH+!**
